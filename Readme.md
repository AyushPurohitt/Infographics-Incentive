# Infographics Incentive

## Project Title
Infographics Incentive

## Project Description
The **Infographics Incentive** project rewards content creators who produce infographics by allowing them to mint an NFT for their infographic. The infographic creator can earn rewards in Ether based on the number of likes and shares their infographic receives. Infographics are stored via IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and are verified before they can generate rewards. This creates a decentralized ecosystem that incentivizes content creators and encourages the sharing and liking of valuable infographics.

## Project Vision
The goal of **Infographics Incentive** is to foster a creative environment where users are rewarded for sharing valuable infographics. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures that content creators are fairly compensated for the impact their content has on others. By using NFTs (ERC-721), content is not only monetized but also preserved securely on the blockchain, offering creators the ability to track and prove ownership.

## Key Objectives
- **Empower Creators**: Enable creators to mint NFTs for their infographics, ensuring transparent ownership and attribution.
- **Engagement Incentives**: Reward creators for likes and shares on their infographics with Ether payments.
- **Content Verification**: Infographics must be verified by the contract owner before being shared or liked, ensuring quality content.
- **Transparent Rewards**: Use blockchain to track and distribute rewards fairly based on engagement.
- **Monetize Social Interactions**: Convert social media actions (likes/shares) into monetary rewards for creators.



## Key Features
- **ERC-721 Infographics**: Each infographic is minted as an NFT, which proves ownership and authenticity.
- **Rewards System**: Creators earn Ether based on how many likes and shares their infographic receives.
- **Verification Process**: Infographics require verification by the contract owner before they can generate rewards.
- **Likes and Shares Tracking**: The contract tracks individual likes and shares using mappings to ensure rewards are distributed fairly.
- **Owner Control**: The contract owner can update reward rates and verification fees, providing flexibility in the system.
- **Event Emissions**: The contract emits events for infographic creation, likes, shares, and reward claims to provide transparency to users.

## Future Improvements
- **Automatic Verification**: Introduce an automated verification system that can verify content without requiring manual intervention by the owner.
- **Additional Reward Mechanisms**: Implement additional ways to earn rewards, such as for comments or other types of engagement.
- **Infographic Analytics**: Provide analytics for creators to see engagement trends (e.g., number of shares, likes over time).
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Expand support to multiple blockchains to increase accessibility and reduce gas fees for users.
- **Tiered Reward System**: Implement a tiered reward system, where more popular infographics receive higher rewards.
